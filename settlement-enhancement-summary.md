# Settlement System Enhancement Summary

## Issue Analysis
Period 20250714416 had all two-sided bets (大小單雙) incorrectly showing as losses, when many should have been wins based on the actual results.

## Root Cause
The comprehensive settlement system was correctly identifying winning bets, but database schema issues prevented proper completion of the settlement process:
1. Missing `total_win` column in `members` table
2. Incompatible `settlement_logs` table schema
3. Missing required columns in transaction records

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Period 416 Settlement ✅
- **Result**: [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 4, 6, 5, 8]
- **Corrected Results**: 10 wins, 10 losses (previously all losses)
- **Total Win Amount**: 19.80 (previously 0.00)
- **User Balance**: Updated correctly with winnings

### 2. Enhanced Settlement System ✅

### 3. Database Schema Fixes ✅
